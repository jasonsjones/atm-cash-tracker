# ATM Cash Tracker

A single page application to track ATM cash withrawals and itemized purchases.
Purchases are rounded to the nearest dollar amount.  This application will be
built on the MEAN stack (mongodb, express, angularjs, and node.js)

The intent with this application is to create something useful as I journey
along the path of learning the above web technologies/frameworks.  I've always
tracked where I spent my cash--starting with writing it down on the back of the
ATM receipt, then moving to a Google Keep note on my phone (or where ever I may
access it from).  Keeping track of my spending this way, the one thing
I always had to do was the mental exercise of calculating how much I have spent
and subseqently how much I should still have in my wallet.

I realize I could simply use a spreadsheet, but ironically, I always thought
that would be overkill--plus, where is the fun in that.

More to come...
