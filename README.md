# ATM Cash Tracker
 
A single page application to trackâ€‹ ATM cash withrawals and itemized
purchases.  Purchases are rounded to the nearest dollar amount.  This
application will be built on the MEAN stack (mongodb, express, angularjs, and
node.js)
 
The intent with this application is to create something useful to me as I
journeyed along the path of learning the technologies/frameworks above.  I've
always tracked where I spend my cash--starting with writing on the back of the
ATM receipt, then moving to a Google Keep note on my phone (or where ever...).
One thing I always had to do was the mental exercise of calculating how much I
have spent and subseqently how much I should still have in my wallet.
 
I realize I could have simply used a spreadsheet, but ironically, thought that
would be overkill--plus, where is the fun in that.

More to come...
